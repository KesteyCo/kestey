	<p><h5 id='smoller'>Hey bae I was following my course and I felt like sweettalking you. I didn't wanna interrupt your session and I wanted you too be two clicks away from accessing your upcoming tbs so yeah here's this. (Also only people with the link could access this, no one can search this up or find it on their own, so dw). It took me like 30 minutes to set this up because my dumbass forgot how to use the hosting service. Anyway enjoy your tbs, love you.</h5><h5 id=smoller>TB#1 I love  you</h5><h5 id='smoller'>I remembered this just today, but back then right after quarantine, dad was driving me somewhere and we went through l'aouina, ba7dha lkniseyya. At exactly that place I had this thought for the first time: "Just how far exactly, in kilometers, is my future wife. it was quite the mystery for me, ama tawa I have the answer, she probably was just short of a 1km far from me at that point in time. Babe I love you, I desire you, and I care for you so much. Just how can a man live, experience your love, and then choose not to have you or simply tries not to fight for you. rak mte3i mouch men tawa w mouch ki araftek. I firmly believe that this was a divine plan from the start, to be your partner and best friend. I hereby pledge to give you my heart. Do with it as you please, for I will always be there for my little clumsy homsa</h5></p></body>
